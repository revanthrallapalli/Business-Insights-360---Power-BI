# Importing data into PowerBi
* As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential

# Data Modelling
* Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report. All the visuals will be build upon the data model.
* Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report.
* In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.
